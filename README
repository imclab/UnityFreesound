	UnityFreesound - Editor tool for Unity3d

	Author: Jorge Garcia [info@jorgegarciamartin.com]

-------------------------------------------------------------

Freesound.org meets Unity3d! Browse, preview, download and credit sounds from Freesound.org within the Unity editor.

Just copy the UnityFreesound folder to the /Editor folder in your Unity project. You will find afterwards two new entries in the Window menu:

- Freesound Browser. Allows searching and browsing sounds for keywords/tags, listen to a preview of the sounds, go to Freesound.org for a more detailed description if you clic on the waveforms, and import the sounds to a user defined folder (/Freesound folder is used as default).
- Freesound Config and Credits. Here you can define a folder where the sounds will be stored. Additionally, export the sounds meta-data to CSV format in order to help you with your application credits.

TODO (22.02.2012):
- User manual with screen captures.
- Examples of usage.
- Advanced search settings.
- Download manager.
- Concurrent preview player.
