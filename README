UnityFreesound - Editor tool for Unity3d
	
Browse, preview, download and credit sounds 
from Freesound.org within the Unity editor.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Import the "UnityFreesound.unitypackage" in your Unity project. Otherwise, you can directly import the contents of the /src folder into your /Editor folder of your Unity project. You will find afterwards two new entries in the Window menu:

- Freesound Browser. Allows searching and browsing sounds for keywords/tags, listen to a preview of the sounds (to STOP after PLAY, press space bar), go to Freesound.org for a more detailed description if you click on the waveforms, and import the sounds to a user defined folder (/Freesound folder is used as default).

- Freesound Config and Credits. Here you can define a folder where the sounds will be stored. Additionally, it allows exporting the sounds metadata to CSV format, so you can easily credit sounds from Freesound in your application :)

TODO (22.02.2012):
- Upload user manual with screen captures.
- Add examples of usage.
- Add Freesound advanced search settings.
- Include a download manager.
- Improve preview player.
